## Narrabeen, Australia, WRL/Andy Short dataset

This dataset is publicly available in the [Narrabeen website](http://narrabeen.wrl.unsw.edu.au/) and was processed as described in the Jupyter Notebook [`1_preprocess_datasets.ipynb`](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/SDS_Benchmark/blob/main/1_preprocess_datasets.ipynb).

The inputs for this site are provided in this folder:
- Region of Interest (ROI): `NARRABEEN_polygon.geojson` in WGS84 (epsg:4326)
- Reference shoreline: `NARRABEEN_reference_shoreline.geojson` in WGS84 (epsg:4326)
- Transect coordinates: `NARRABEEN_transects.geojson`  in WGS84 (epsg:4326)

It is recommended to use `epsg:28356` as a local projected coordinate system.

The time-series of shoreline change were extracted from in situ surveys for the 0.7 m AHD contour (equivalent to MHWS):

Additional information to perform a tidal/wave correction is also provided:
- Beach-face slope: use $tan\beta = 0.1$
- Modelled tide levels: `NARRABEEN_tides.csv` dates in UTC time and tide levels in metres Above Mean Sea Level
- Hindcast wave parameters: `NARRABEEN_waves_ERA5.csv` dates in UTC time and wave parameters are from ERA5 reanalysis.
