## Mapped locations

We produced shoreline time-series for the following locations (check locations):

- [x] NARRABEEN
- [x] DUCK
- [x] TRUCVERT
- [x] TORREYPINES

## Algorithm/workflow description

We used the algorithm HT-SDS as described in detail in Mao et al. (2021). The algorithm retrieved **annual** shoreline at **high tide** with image compositing methods, optimized for efficiency with the entire workflow implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform.
The model is implemented with the GEE python API that was used here.

## Workflow to reproduce
Change to the algorithm directory
```bash
cd ../../algorithms/UQMAO
```
The algorithm can be implemented for a site by simply launching
```bash
python SDSRetrieve.py --SITE SITENAME
```
To check other options to tune:
```bash
python SDSRetrieve.py -h
```

## Estimation of effort

The time it took to run the workflow was estimated below. The computation time can be substantially smaller (down to 20 sec for all sites) if a site was processed recently. The computation time in the table is based on the first-time (longest) processing.
Since the entire workflow is based on GEE, it has no requirement for client-side computational resources. 

| Location    | Download time (hrs) | Mapping time (hrs) | Total time (hrs) |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| NARRABEEN | 0                    | 0.05                   | 0.05         |
| DUCK     | 0                     |       0.05               |      0.05            |
| TRUCVERT    |	0                       |         0.1             |        0.1          |
| TORREYPINES    |	0                        |      0.15                |    0.15              |

## Additional information

When comparing this algorithm to others:
1.This algorithm is optimized for efficiency instead of accuracy to achieve global implementation so the entire workflow was based on GEE. Nothing except the final shoreline positions was downloaded;
2.The algorithm retrieved annual shoreline position instead of instantaneous ones, so had much smaller temporal frequency;
3.The algorithm retrieved shoreline at high tide instead of mean sea level with image compositing instead of tidal correction with water level data. But it may be necessary to use water level data to transform the high-tide position from this algorithm to mean sea level in order to directly compare with other algorithms
, especially for TORREYPINES and TRUCVERT site.
4.Since all Landsat images were composited, this algorithm does not distinguish the “satname” as an individual column in output files.
